        <p>Planetary Pendragon (also known as “PlaPen”) is an unpublished military-political science fiction and fantasy graphic novel trilogy. It is set in the 23rd century where humankind is united under a kingdom and has expanded to encompass two solar systems, all protected by the Kingdom’s official military, the Avalon Interstellar Knighthood. This extensive project involves several different forms of design, such as concept art, storyboarding, and 3D modeling. The three starships shown here are, top to bottom: Caliburn class battleship (named after King Arthur’s sword Excalibur), Rhongomyniad class cruiser (named for Arthur’s spear), and Carnwennan class starfighter (named for Arthur’s dagger).</p>
