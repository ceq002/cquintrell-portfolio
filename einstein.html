        <h1>Einstein@Home website redesign</h1>
        <p>
            Einstein@Home is a citizen science project, made to help everyday people contribute to the discovery of
            pulsars, a type of rapidly spinning neutron star, by using their computers’ idle and unused resources. The
            redesign of this website involved a redesign of the logo to more explicitly show its purpose. The original
            website, though it displays a banner at the top showing a space background, mostly had a light gray
            background that did not help to show its purpose, so the space background was expanded to encompass the
            entire viewport.
