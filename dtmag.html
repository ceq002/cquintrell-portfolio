        <h2>Case Study: Original design vs. Revisions</h2>
        <p>This fictional magazine was designed around internet horror, such as the SCP universe, horror podcasts, and the works of Trevor 
Henderson, along with analog horror such as Local 58, Thalasin, and The Mandela Catalogue. Several different types of magazine pages were included, such as a table of contents and advertisements, along with a feature spread. The fonts were selected based on both horror and the internet. Revisions included the addition of two spreads, changes to the cover and table of contents, and a mockup.
