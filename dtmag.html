        <h1>DigitalTerror Internet Horror Magazine</h1>
        <h2>Case Study: Original design vs. Revisions</h2>
        <p>
            This fictional magazine was designed around internet horror, such as the SCP universe, horror podcasts, and
            the works of Trevor Henderson, along with analog horror such as Local 58, Thalasin, and The Mandela
            Catalogue. Several different types of magazine pages were included, such as a table of contents and
            advertisements, along with a feature spread. The fonts were selected based on both horror and the internet.
            <br /><br /><strong>Software Used:</strong> Adobe InDesign
