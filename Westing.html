        <h1>The Westing Game cover redesign</h1>
        <p>
            The book cover, which is also unofficial due to being part of a class assignment, was designed based on the
            “vibe” gleaned from the description on the back cover. This vibe involved old-fashioned text and a graphic
            of a similarly old-fashioned house. The cover uses a color palette that includes cyan, yellow, and a dark
            gray. The cover also uses some official logos, such as the Puffin Books logo and the Newbery Medal. A case
            study on the cover involved a lightening of the cyan background, removal of orphans and widows, and a
            mockup.
