        <h1>The Westing Game cover redesign</h1>
            <img src="assets/westing-game-cover-v2-mockup.png" alt="A revised book cover design for The Westing Game">
            <p>The book cover, which is also unofficial due to being part of a class assignment, was designed based on the “vibe” gleaned from the description on the back cover. This vibe involved old-fashioned text and a graphic of a similarly old-fashioned house. The cover uses a color palette that includes cyan, yellow, and a dark gray. The cover also uses some official logos, such as the Puffin Books logo and the Newbery Medal. A case study on the cover involved a lightening of the cyan background, removal of orphans and widows, and a mockup.</p>
