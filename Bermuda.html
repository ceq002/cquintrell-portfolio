        <h1>Beautiful Bermuda website</h1>
        <p>
            This website was designed based on the memory of a cruise to the British territory located in the West
            Atlantic. The website was made to provide information to prospective tourists to the country, such as its
            culture and history, along with tourist destinations and the country’s efforts to conserve an iconic
            species, the cahow. Specific fonts were selected to appear friendlier to the audience so that visiting
            Bermuda would be more attractive. Revisions included adding a “quick facts” section to the home page, and
            changing the fonts.
